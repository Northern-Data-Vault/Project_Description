**Northern Data Vault (NDV) Project**:

The Northern Data Vault is a multi-disciplinary project to create and maintain a snapshot of the global North in 2020. This project combines information from various databases and open sources (such as Open Street Maps and open government portals), using available geospatial information to allow integration. It will be powered by an open source, vendor-neutral, technology stack including CentOS, PostgreSQL, and PostGIS.  This project will leverage a co-creation methodology which will facilitate ethical stewardship of this information by/with Indigenous and First Nations populations by applying the principles of CARE (https://www.gida-global.org/care) and OCAP (https://fnigc.ca/ocap).
